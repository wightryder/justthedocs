## The Cripplestyle Benches
### by Adrian King

If you travel from Alderholt to Cranborne, just before you reach Cripplestyle, on the left, behind the hedgerow you will just make out a small hill. It has the name **King Barrow**! It is a popular destination for short walks, with a panoramic view of the surrounding area when you reach the top!

At 324ft King Barrow is the highest hill in the district. The area consists of 23.62 acres of common land (registered units CL 253 and CL 162). The hill itself is not a tumulus but a natural mound.

On a clear day it was at one time possible to see the white cliffs of the Isle of Wight. I have in the past seen the flare stacks of the oil refinery at Fawley. It was also possible under the right conditions to see the top of Salisbury Cathedral spire. But the trees have grown so much that the distant view is now restricted. Clear cutting recently by the Cranborne Wild Heath Project has made new views possible.
